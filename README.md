Pixel Manipulation for Image Ecryption

Develop a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. You can perform operations like swapping pixel values or applying a basic mathematical operation to each pixel. Allow users to encrypt and decrypt images.

In this program we open an image and do some simple mathematical operation(XOR operation) to encrypt or decrypt the image but you have to use the same key
to encrypt or decrypt the image.
